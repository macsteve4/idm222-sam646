                  <h3>Some Background...</h3>
                  <p class="about">I am interested in honing my creative and artistic skill with a blend of my love of technology. I believe that it is incredibly necessary to utilize creative expression in our digital lives, especially as designers.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  While my studies have taken me closer towards the field of UI/UX design, I have had the opportunity to grow my creative gallery. My skills and interests follow; <b> design for media production, html & css, adobe creative cloud software, user-demographic research, photography, & interface/interaction design</b>.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I have been making art since I could pick up a pencil. I would always be doodling in class or sketching funny scenes in my mind. As I grew, I took a four year arts and media program at my high school.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  As my creative endeavors expand, so will this site. I have been pursuing interests in music production and focusing in on marketing communications in addition to my digital art.
