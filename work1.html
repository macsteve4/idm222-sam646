            <h3>WCSJ REDESIGN</h3>
            <p>My User Interface Design class (IDM-212), followed us redesigning a news-based website for 3 breakpoints; (phone, tablet, desktop). I decided to redesign WCSJ News, a county news site that had a terrible use of space and hardly any mobile support.</p>
            <div class="projectwork">
              <img src="imagesscaled/wcsjold.png" alt="Three different sized screens of the old WCSJ website.">
            </div>
            <p>At first I grabbed screens of the website at the various breakpoints. This was important for me, as I needed to map out the points where the site didn’t work, and easily plan strategies for the redesign and improvement.</p>
            <div class="projectwork">
              <img src="imagesscaled/wireframe.png" alt="A low fidelity wireframe of the three screens, on one pane and comprised of gray boxes.">
            </div>
            <p>I then translated the site’s components into sections, and broke them down individually. This loose wireframe of the old site would help when I began to build my new design in Sketch. In addition to building the design, we would use Flinto to design 5 unique interactions per breakpoint.</p>
            <div class="projectwork">
              <img src="imagesscaled/wscjsketch.png" alt="Various sketches of website designs on sketch paper.">
            </div>
            <p>My personal favorite part was the design and mock-up phase. Our instructor challenged us to make 25 unique designs for the breakpoints. I was able to think outside of the box a bit and consider elements that would allow me to create a design with 5 unique interactions.</p>
            <div class="projectwork">
              <img src="imagesscaled/wcsjnew.png" alt="Three different sized screens of Steven's redesigned WCSJ website.">
            </div>
            <p>Above are the final screens of my WSCJ website redesign. Working in Flinto and figuring out where to place the interactions was certainly a challenge. It was rewarding to improve the website, and I realized the importance of an adjustable interface across different screen sizes to maintain continuity.</p>
